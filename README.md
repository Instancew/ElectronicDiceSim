# ElectronicDiceSim
A college project in which an Electronic circuit was created to make a d6 dice simulator.

This was a college undergraduate project for a Basic Electronics Engineering course in my First Year.
The hardware side of the project included:
- 20x4 LCD with I2C adapter
- Arduino Uno R3 board
- Piezo Buzzer
- Jumper Cables
- Data Cable for Data Transmission and Power Source

There were plans to add a power source but could not due to time constraints. Will update the circuit diagram respectively, once updated.

The code was written using C++ in Arduino IDE. It uses the random() function and generated a number between 1 to 6, and generated a unique dot pattern respectively,
to mimic the face of the die. The code can be easily modified to make a d2, d4, d32 respectively,

This was my first experience with an Electronic project, and I believe the results were fruitful.
